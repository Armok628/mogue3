The second rewrite of an old game of mine, adding various new features

Ideas:

* Effects system for entities (e.g. poison) and tiles (e.g. fire)
	* Event functions (upon moving, dying, etc.)
* Loot tables for areas
* Add-on enabled spells
* Better question-mark key functionality (tile descriptions?)
* Randomized items and creatures
* More creatures and items
* Biomes by temperature (longitude and altitude)
* Player building (but for what purpose?)
