# temporary
This is a project I'm not sure I want to follow through to completion

It's another rewrite of mogue. I guess I keep redoing my old projects until I'm satisfied, I suppose.
It happened with my LISP interpreter, and now it's actually a pretty good compiler, I like to think.
Hopefully the same will happen here.

Making CSL taught me a lot about source code organization, and my programming style has improved ***dramatically*** since then.
This time around, I feel like I can keep adding to the game without getting bogged down with details and rookie mistakes.

Ideas for features/implementations:

* World map, with persistent areas (array of structs with pointers to tile arrays)
* Settlements with different building generation parameters (cities, villages, huts, etc.)
* Biomes (different obstacles, colors, symbols, etc.)
* Rafts for shallow water, boats for deep water
* Scrolling screen
* Saving and loading
