The second rewrite of an old game of mine, adding various new features

Ideas:

* More creatures and items
* Player building (but for what purpose?)
* Better question-mark key functionality (tile descriptions?)
* Biomes by temperature (longitude and altitude)
* Easier creature definitions
* More randomized items and creatures
* Effects system (poison, etc.)
* Environmental effects (fire, etc.)
