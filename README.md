The second rewrite of an old game of mine, adding various new features

Ideas:

* Interesting spells/spellcasting creatures
* More biome-specific creatures
* Items (trading, possibly?)
* More fleshed-out dynamic spawning (maxima/minima?)
* Player building (but for what purpose?)
* Better question-mark key functionality (tile descriptions?)
* Biomes by temperature (longitude and altitude)
* Easier creature definitions
* More randomized items and creatures
* Effects system (burning, disease, etc.)
