The second rewrite of an old game of mine, adding various new features

Ideas:

* Loot tables for areas
* Add-on enabled spells
* Creature AI for picking up and using items
* Effects system for entities (e.g. poison) and tiles (e.g. fire)
* Better question-mark key functionality (tile descriptions?)
* Randomized items and creatures
* More creatures and items
* Biomes by temperature (longitude and altitude)
* Player building (but for what purpose?)
