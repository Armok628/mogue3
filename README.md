The second rewrite of an old game of mine, adding various new features

Ideas:

* Loot tables for areas
* Modularize world generation
* Add-on enabled spells
* Better question-mark key functionality (tile descriptions?)
* Randomized items and creatures
* More creatures and items
* Biomes by temperature (longitude and altitude)
